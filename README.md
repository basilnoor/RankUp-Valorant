# RankUp-Valorant
### Hosted Live: https://rankup-valorant.firebaseapp.com/

### Languages/Frameworks/Tools used:

- Javascript, CSS, HTML, React, Chakra UI, FireBase, Valorant-API, Visual Studio Code 

### Project Goals:

- Create a website that can be utilized by the users of **/r/VALORANT** and other players new to the game to aid in the learning curve.
- Work with React to create a fully responsive web design.
- Utilize Chakra UI to aid in styling and getting experience with UI frameworks
- Engaging with valorant-api in order to make GET/PULL requests and utilize said requests in order to display necessary information on the app
- Make use of google Firebase in order to host the app

### Future Goals:

- No set goals
- The styling can be cleaned up in mobile, but the goal of the project was to progress my skills with react and front-end design.
- The app should keep up to date with the game as long as the API is maintained, but if the API gets more information I will add more pages to the website to improve its functionality for the users.

### Documentation:

> *I recommend everyone to check out the app itself since it is hosted live, but in case you want to see me cover the pages I will add videos quickly going over each page respectively.*
